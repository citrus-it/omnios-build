SUMMARY="Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions, version 2"
DESC="The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression"
DESC+=" pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5"

# 10.37 - libpcre-posix.so changed from .2 to .3 as a set of compatibility
#         functions was removed. We continue to build and provide
